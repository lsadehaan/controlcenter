# Release Notes

This file contains release notes for Control Center. When a new tag is pushed, the CI/CD pipeline will automatically create a GitHub release using the notes for that version.

## Format

Each release should have a section with the version number as a heading level 2 (`##`). The content under that heading will be used as the release notes.

## v0.11.2

### Fixes

- **Fixed push-config not detecting committed changes**: Agent now properly detects local commits ahead of remote, not just uncommitted files
- **Auto-update git remote URL on startup**: Agents automatically update from HTTP to SSH URLs when needed
- **Improved push error reporting**: Clear error messages with proper exit codes
- **Better change detection**: Separate warnings for uncommitted changes vs committed changes ahead of remote

### Changes

- Added `HasCommitsAhead()` function to detect local commits that need pushing
- Push operation now works with both uncommitted and already-committed changes
- Remote URL automatically updated during git config setup

### Upgrading from v0.11.0 or v0.11.1

This release fixes the issues discovered in v0.11.0/v0.11.1:
1. Agents with existing HTTP URLs will automatically switch to SSH
2. Push operations will now properly detect and push all local changes
3. Better error messages help diagnose push failures

---

## v0.11.1

### Fixes

- **Fixed misleading push-config success message**: Agent now properly reports when push fails with HTTP 403 or other errors
- **Auto-update git remote URL**: Agents upgrading from HTTP to SSH will automatically update their remote URL
- **Proper exit codes**: `-push-config` now exits with code 1 on failure for script detection
- **Better error messages**: Clear indication when push fails with actionable error details

### Upgrading from v0.11.0

If you upgraded to v0.11.0 and are seeing HTTP 403 errors when pushing:
1. Upgrade agent to v0.11.1
2. Agent will automatically update the git remote URL from HTTP to SSH
3. Push will work correctly

### Related Issues
- Agents with existing HTTP remote URLs couldn't push after v0.11.0 upgrade
- Push failures were silently reported as success

---

## v0.11.0

### New Features

- **Git-over-SSH for Configuration Sync**: Manager now runs Git SSH server on port 2223
- **SSH-based Authentication**: Agents authenticate using their SSH keys for config pulls
- **Automatic Config Preservation**: Agent configuration preserved during re-registration

### Changes

- Git SSH port changed from 9418 to 2223
- Agents now use SSH protocol instead of Git protocol for config sync
- Docker configuration updated to expose Git SSH port

### Breaking Changes

Manager and agents must both be upgraded to v0.11.0 for Git sync to work properly.

### Deployment Notes

- Update firewall rules to allow port 2223 for Git SSH
- Docker deployments automatically configured with correct ports
- Native deployments may need manual firewall configuration
