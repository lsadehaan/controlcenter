### Configuration

Add to agent configuration to enable:
```json
{
  "fileBrowserSettings": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowedPaths": [
      "C:\\Projects\\myproject",
      "/home/user/data",
      "~/documents"
    ],
    "maxUploadSize": 104857600,
    "maxListItems": 1000
  }
}
```

### API Endpoints

All endpoints are proxied through the manager:
- `GET /api/agents/:id/files/browse?path=...` - Browse directory
- `GET /api/agents/:id/files/download?path=...` - Download file
- `POST /api/agents/:id/files/upload` - Upload file (multipart/form-data)
- `POST /api/agents/:id/files/mkdir?path=...` - Create directory
- `DELETE /api/agents/:id/files/delete?path=...` - Delete file/folder

### Implementation Details

### Improvements

- Added `syncDatabaseAfterPush()` method to GitSSHServer that reads config from Git and updates database
- Added `updateAgentConfig()` method to Database class for targeted config updates
- Automatic sync ensures UI always reflects latest agent configuration

### Impact

- UI now displays current agent configuration immediately after agent pushes changes
- No manual intervention required to sync database with Git repository
- Resolves discrepancy between Git repository (source of truth) and database (UI state)

### Technical Details

When an agent pushes configuration via Git SSH:
1. `git-receive-pack` completes successfully
2. Git repository is updated with new configuration
3. Manager reads the updated config file from Git
4. Manager updates the agent's config column in database
5. UI immediately reflects the changes on next page load/refresh

### Deployment

1. Update Manager to v0.11.9 and restart
2. Agents do not require changes for this fix

---

## v0.11.4

### Improvements

- **Enhanced Git SSH server logging**: Comprehensive error logging for all stream and process errors
- **Real-time stderr logging**: Git errors logged immediately as they occur
- **Stream error handling**: Added error handlers for all pipe connections
- **Better debugging**: Logs when streams close and processes are killed

### Changes

- Manager: Log all git stderr output in real-time
- Manager: Add error handlers for stdin/stdout pipes
- Manager: Log SSH stream closure events
- Manager: Track and log all git process lifecycle events

### Purpose

This release adds extensive logging to help diagnose Git SSH push/pull issues. No functional changes, only improved observability.

---

## v0.11.5

### Critical Fixes

- Fix Git-over-SSH push hang: Use stateful SSH protocol (no `--stateless-rpc`) and correct bidirectional piping
- Send SSH exit-status properly and avoid premature channel close; client now receives exit code 0 on success
- Forward git stderr to SSH channel for proper client-side progress/errors

### Improvements

- Hardened stream handling: prevent auto-ending SSH channel by using `{ end: false }` on stdout/stderr pipes
- More robust lifecycle logging for git child process and SSH channel

### Impact

- Agents and developers can push to `ssh://<manager>:2223/config-repo` reliably without hangs
- No schema changes; Manager restart required

### Upgrading

1. Update Manager to v0.11.5 and restart
2. Agents do not require changes for this fix

---

## v0.11.8

### Improvements

- **Enhanced backup notifications when pulling config**: Agent now clearly warns when local changes are detected and backed up during pull
- **Clear recovery instructions**: Shows exact commands to recover backed up changes (`./agent -recover-backup latest`)
- **Abort on backup failure**: Pull now aborts if backup fails, preventing accidental data loss
- **Better logging**: Uses warning level (yellow) for backup notifications to ensure visibility

### Changes

- Pull() now logs prominent warnings when backing up local changes
- BackupLocalChanges() provides clear recovery instructions for both stash and branch backups
- Failed backups now abort the pull operation instead of proceeding with caution

### Impact

- Users will no longer miss when their local changes are being backed up
- Clearer path to recovery when changes diverge
- Prevents data loss from failed backups

### Deployment

1. Update Agent to v0.11.8
2. No manager changes required

---

## v0.11.7

### Critical Fixes

- **Fix "Working directory has unstaged changes" push rejection**: Manager now auto-commits any pending changes in config-repo on startup to ensure clean working directory
- This allows agents to push successfully when using `receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead`

### Improvements

- Added `autoCommitPendingChanges()` method to GitServer that runs on startup for existing repositories
- Automatically stages and commits all changes with timestamped message

### Impact

- Agents can now reliably push configurations without "Working directory has unstaged changes" errors
- Manager working directory stays clean automatically
- No manual intervention required after manager updates

### Deployment

1. Update Manager to v0.11.7 and restart
2. Agents do not require changes

---

## v0.11.6

### Improvements

- Manager automatically configures the config-repo to accept pushes to the checked-out branch by setting `receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead` during startup (and ensures it for existing repos).

### Impact

- Eliminates manual server-side configuration after install/upgrade when agents push configs via SSH.

### Deployment

- Restart the Manager service after upgrade; no agent changes required.

---

## v0.11.3

### Critical Fixes

- **Fixed Git SSH server hanging**: Manager now correctly uses `.git` directory for git-upload-pack, resolving infinite hang on git operations

- **Fixed agent hanging on git fetch**: Added 10-second timeout to prevent indefinite hangs when manager is unreachable
- **Auto-update git remote URL on startup**: Agents automatically update from HTTP to SSH URLs when needed

### Improvements

- **Better error logging**: Manager logs detailed git process errors, exit codes, and stderr output
- **Improved push error reporting**: Agent shows clear error messages with proper exit codes
- **Better change detection**: Separate warnings for uncommitted changes vs committed changes ahead of remote
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: All git operations work correctly on both Windows and Linux
- **Automated release tagging**: Releases now automatically marked as "latest" for deploy scripts

### Changes

- Manager: Use `.git` directory path for git commands in non-bare repositories
- Manager: Remove `shell: true` from spawn to fix deprecation warning
- Agent: Added `HasCommitsAhead()` function to detect local commits that need pushing
- Agent: Push operation now works with both uncommitted and already-committed changes
- Agent: Remote URL automatically updated during git config setup
- Agent: Git fetch operations timeout after 10 seconds instead of hanging forever
- CI/CD: Releases automatically tagged as latest

### Upgrading from v0.11.0, v0.11.1, or v0.11.2
