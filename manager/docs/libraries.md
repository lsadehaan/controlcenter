Note: Only core scaffolding dependencies are installed now. The following are planned per the Blueprint and will be added as features are implemented.

## Web/API
- Express: Minimalist web framework for HTTP APIs and routing.
- EJS: Simple server-side templating for admin UI.

## Real-time
- ws: WebSocket server for agent heartbeats and live UI updates.

## Git & Config
- nodegit or git CLI wrapper: Manage per-agent configuration repos and commits.

## Database
- SQLite: Embedded storage for small-footprint default. Swappable to other DBs later.

## Notifications
- Nodemailer: Email notifications; adapters for Slack/other channels later.

## Visual Builder
- Drawflow.js: Node-based visual editor for workflow design.
